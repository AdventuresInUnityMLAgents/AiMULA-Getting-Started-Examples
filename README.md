# AiMULA-Getting-Started-Examples
Simple examples of three (classic) reinforcement-learing games that can be trained using the Unity Ml-Agents Toolbox: Catch Ball, Wall Pong and Pong





# Background
The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit or ML-Agents is a free, open-source Unity plugin that integrates Unity Technologies Unity3D real-time 3D development platform [Unity-Pro Personal addition is free], with a Python API for developing and testing artificial agents (AIs) using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and other neural network and machine learning techniques. 

The developers of the Unity ML-Agents toolkit have done a fantastic job of making the toolkit as easy to use as possible, especially if you are familiar with the Unity platform and have basic programming skills (C# and Python in particular). The toolkit also includes 10 Example Environments and a tutorial on creating an ML-Agents Unity Environment for AI training and testing. The three games included here provide an additional set of example environments. 

NOTE: We provide a complete the tutorial on how to create the Wall Pong environment and train an ML-Agent to play Wall Pong at:
